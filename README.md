# Audio-and-Signal

## 1. basic notes, tempo, beats, and looping

In Ruby, `use_bpm` is a method that can be used to set the tempo of an audio file. It is often used in music production applications and libraries to control the timing of a musical composition.

Write `x.times do` at the beginning and *end* at the end of your melody, you can repeat a sequence of notes multiple times in a loop.

You can write the notes in MIDI, which is basically numbers between 0 and 127 or in musical notes. `play y`

If you want to play each note in a sequence, you have to tell to take a break every now and then. Try typing in `sleep z` underneath each note
